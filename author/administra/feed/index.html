			<h4>From Fontana’s glaring punctured canvases to Boetti’s conceptual maps, Italian Post-War Art stole the show at this year’s Frieze Art Fair</h4>
<p>Art lovers and anyone who’s anyone in the art world stormed London from 3 to 6 October to attend the highlight of the art-world calendar, historic and contemporary art fairs <a href="https://frieze.com/fairs/frieze-london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frieze London</a> and <a href="https://frieze.com/fairs/frieze-masters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frieze Masters</a>. More than 290 galleries brought a terrific selection of objects on sale to Regent’s Park spanning thousands of years of history of art, from antiquity to post-war global art, performance, and sculptures. ArtSquare.io’s Art Department was there and handpicked the most strikingly-curated booths from both fairs. Our highlights are all about curious surfaces, saturated palettes, and kinetic pieces.</p>

			<p>For the fifth consecutive year at Frieze, art-market-giant Hauser &amp; Wirth collaborated with gallery for Renaissance art Moretti Fine Art on the booth. Spread across six “rooms” divided by lush wooden walls, “<a href="https://morettigallery.com/exhibitions/46/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Before and After, at the Same Time: Rome, Milan, and Fabio Mauri</a>” was a sophisticated exploration of post-war contemporary Italian filtered through the philosophical lens of multi-disciplinary 20th-century artist <a href="https://morettigallery.com/exhibitions/46/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fabio Mauri</a>. Works by Alberto Burri, Alighiero Boetti, Enrico Castellani, Lucio Fontana, Jannis Kounellis, Piero Manzoni, Mimmo Rotella and Mario Schifano—among others—were elegantly brought together with Old Masters paintings on the ground of both formal affinities and uncanny differences in terms of scale, meaning, and modes of visual delivery. The result was a dazzling visual journey through key moments and ideas of six centuries of Italian art.</p>

			<p>Hauser &amp; Wirth pulled out all the stops to steal the hearts of visitors and dealers at the fairs and succeeded magnificently. According to <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/price-check-frieze-london-2019-1667476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artnet</a>‘s report of sales and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-sold-frieze-london-10-07-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others</a>, Mario Schifano’s <em>Untitled </em>from 1961 sold for the astonishing figure of $988,000 and Mimmo Rotella’s décollage on canvas from the same year for $511,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Tornabuoni Art, Frieze Masters</h4>
<p>A dazzling horizontal mirror painting by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0usNfTjLCN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelangelo Pistoletto</a> placed center stage in the elegantly symmetrical booth of <a href="http://www.tornabuoniarte.it/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tornabuoni Art</a> acted as a magnet upon visitors at this year’s Frieze Masters. In the past ten years, the modern and contemporary art gallery increasingly specialized in post-war contemporary art from the 1960s, and the world-class selection of objects brought to the London’s fair this year is the peak of its research activity. Alighiero Boetti’s colorful and playful tapestries —a large<em> Mappa</em> and a word-embroidery— offered a dazzling counterpoint to the monochromatic pairing of Fontana’s six-time-gushed, pristine <em>Spatial concept </em>and Alberto Burri’s dreamily suspended <em>Plastica</em>. Bringing about an experience of space and matter as well as of pure vision in the encounter with the work of art, the cleverly-curated corner was undoubtedly our favorite from the whole fair.</p>

			<h4>3. Mazzoleni Art, Frieze Masters</h4>
<p><span title="Edited">Mazzoleni Art’s <em>Celestial Bodies</em> was also all about post-1960s Italian contemporary art. The booth brought together works that explore scientific ideas of the cosmos by Alberto Burri, Alexander Calder, Enrico Castellani, Lucio Fontana, Giulio Turcato, Victor Vasarely among others. Turcato’s lifelong exploration of form, texture, the limits of representation and of the visible world was made more acute by the moon landing in 1969. His <em>Lunar Surfaces</em> Painting are painted on rubber foam. In all their attractive roughness and enigmatic imagery, they marvel and challenge the viewer at the same time. Another showstopper was the juxtaposition of Calder’s mobile <em>Little Red </em>and Burri’s <em>Red Plastic, </em>an experiment in setting in motion form, color, and matter. A pretty unique Fontana—a glittered sparkling canvas slashed with a hole in the center— completed Mazzoleni’s all-star and astral array of objects.</span></p>

			<h4>4. Galleria Franco Noero, Frieze London</h4>
<p>Turin’s Galleria Franco Noero drew a crowd at Frieze London with its minimalist set-up of sculptures, paintings, and installations by some of the most cutting-edge living artists. <a href="https://www.artribune.com/tag/lara-favaretto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lara Favaretto</a>‘s <em>BOOTH</em> from 2017 with its eternally twirling car-wash brushes made it to thousands of Instagram profiles. It also caught the attention of Scottish super-collector and art patroness Nicky Wilson. During a curated shopping tour of the fair together with <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/nicky-wilson-frieze-walkthrough-1668697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artnet</a>, Wilson’s collector eye was mesmerized by Favaretto’s swirling sculpture but was also more practically interested in how to maintain it. For those who were wondering: Favaretto’s work comes with replacement brushes.</p>

			<p>It has been an eventful couple of months for Artsquare.io: we launched the <strong>Beta version</strong> of our platform just in time for our <strong>first Digital Art Listing</strong>, selling for the first time in history <strong>100% of an Artwork</strong> available as <strong>Digital Art Shares</strong> at the price of <strong>€ 1</strong>. We picked a world-class artwork for our debut in the art industry, Andy Warhol’s screen print from 1984 <em>Kiku</em>. Unremittingly modern and visually catchy, <em>Kiku</em> was the perfect object to introduce our vision of a revolutionary way of buying and owning art.</p>

<p><strong>Alighiero Boetti and the Market for Contemporary Art</strong></p>
<p>Alighiero Boetti (Turin, 1940- Rome, 1994) is a key revolutionary figure of Italian contemporary art. A Conceptual artist often associated with Arte Povera, he is best known for his series of embroidered maps and sentences. Arte Povera artists worked with readily available and inexpensive materials that challenged the status of the art object. Their use of non-traditional artistic media drawn from everyday life insisted on art’s connection with the commonplace.<br />
Boetti created the series of <em>Mappe</em> (Maps) and lettering works between 1971 and 1994. These are works of conceptual art: they were conceived by the artist and executed by groups of anonymous female embroiderers in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ArtSquare.io is listing one of Boetti’s latest lettered embroideries with the sentence ‘una brillante idea’, which translates as a <em>brilliant idea</em>. Boetti has broken down the sentence into a sequence of single letters arranged from top to bottom in four vertical stripes.The work has all the trademark elements of Boetti’s style: the exploration of the whole color spectrum, the opposition between fulness and void, the element of harmony within disorder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boetti’s works are exhibited in the <b>most important museums across the world</b>, including the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the MoMA, New York, the LACMA, Los Angeles and the Tate Modern, London. The highlight of the artist’s market performance was the <b>record sale</b> of the sculpture <i>Colonna </i>(Column) for <b>€ 2,634,450</b> at <b>Christie’s London</b>’s Italian Sale in October 2014. Estimated between € 1,881,750 and € 2,509,000 (£ 1,500,000 – £ 2,000,000), the two-meter tall cylinder of stacked paper doilies is a landmark artwork from Boetti’s early exploration with <i>Arte Povera</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Only 17.1% of Boetti’s works are still available on the market,</b> which means that his maps and embroideries are <b>highly sought-after</b> by art collectors worldwide. In the past ten years, Boetti’s works have registered an <b>increasingly positive trend</b>, with an overall <b>appreciation rate of + 974,3%</b>. The success of Boetti’s works on the market is undeniable: with ArtSquare.io, you can also own your piece of a Boetti and make profits from the artwork as a whole asset, becoming an Art Investor while enjoying the feeling of being an art collector.</p>
<p>As you wait for your booked DAS to be transferred to your Portfolio when the Listing goes live, read about <i>Una brillante idea</i>, review, and download its facts in the dedicated section of the Listing in your ArtSquare account.</p>

			<p>Having access to an artwork’s history of ownership is key to understanding, determining, and controlling its value. ArtSquare.io allows you to oversee every aspect of your Artwork’s story with its <strong>Repository feature</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Repository is a folder for the documents related to the Artwork</strong>: its details —museum-label style information like title, artist, date and medium—, provenance information, authenticity certificate and condition report. The information is also gathered and summarised into an easily-legible fact sheet compiled by our <strong>art advisory partner</strong>. Our community of Art Investors can <strong>view</strong> and <strong>download</strong> the documents by heading to the dedicated section of the Artwork’s Listing page.</p>
<p>Documents like provenance records and the certificate of authenticity are vital to ensure that the artwork or collectible we are selling is original and has been fairly appraised. They are also the first step towards a <strong>successful listing</strong>. Putting together provenance documentation, authenticity certificates, and other legal paperwork can be a long and tiresome process. For this reason, we are entrusting <strong>Art Pros</strong>—art market professional  players such as art galleries, auction houses, art advisors, and art dealers—with the task of uploading the key documentation for the artwork they are looking to list on ArtSquare.io. Art Pros can sign up for a Business profile and also start a Listing request on behalf of a private art owner.</p>
<p>By collaborating with traditional players with proven expertise in the art industry, we want to make sure that the documentation we are receiving is accurate and that the artwork you are investing in is worth your money. The same process of accompanying the object with its track record before it is sold through an auction house or private art dealer is standard practice in the art market.</p>

<p>Transparency and simplification are our core values, and the Repository reflects them in every aspect. Art Pros can continue to update Artwork’s information (if necessary) throughout the primary as well as secondary sale in the ArtSquare Exchange. This could be the case with changes in the artwork’s provenance: when at the end of the primary sale for <em>Kiku</em>, our currently fully-listed artwork, <strong>the Top Art Investor </strong>—the majority DAS holder—will be the owner of the screen print for six months, his or her name will be added to the provenance record to reflect the new ownership, and so on for the following owners during the trading of DAS.</p>
<p>We use Blockchain technology to encrypt the Repository in each Digital Art Share of an Artwork. This ensures that the documents are always accessible and bound to a portion of value of the object. The information in the Repository is immutable thanks to the Blockchain’s bullet-proof archival feature. In addition, the Repository will also store the <strong>Modular Smart Contract</strong>, an ownership agreement established between the parties at the moment of listing an artwork. This is a big change compared to what usually happens in the art market, where authenticity certificates and provenance records are often tampered with to affect the artwork’s value and scam art buyers.</p>
<p>We are on the hunt for the people who share our desire of removing the barriers to entry to the art market by embracing fractionalisation and digital trading. If you are an art market professional player and are interested in listing an artwork on ArtSquare.io, drop us a message and we will assist you in the process. And if you’re an Art Investor, check out our upcoming listing: you can now <strong>pre-book Digital Art Shares</strong> in Alighiero Boetti’s conceptual artwork <em>Una brillante idea. </em>Start buying your way to the top of the Art Investors leaderboard and own the work for six months.</p>

			<p>ArtSquare.io’s first digital art listing is happening now. You can buy Digital Art Shares for Andy Warhol’s <em>Kiku</em>, the first artwork to be fractionalised in full in history, starting from € 1. We have devised the easiest and safest way possible to turn you into an Art Owner. Buying DAS of <em>Kiku</em> is as easy as paying for an Uber. Once you have created your Wallet on ArtSquare.io, just add funds by using your credit card—you can read more information on how our built-in Wallet works <a href="/wallet-currencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. In the Listing section of the platform you can type in the amount of shares you want to buy and your order will be processed instantly. <strong>You are now an Art Owner.</strong></p>

To be able to enjoy their gift, the receiver needs to claim your DAS within 15 days by Signing Up to ArtSquare.io as a new user or retrieve them through their Portfolio. When you decide to donate DAS to someone, Digital Art Shares will be transferred from your Portfolio to the receiver’s. ArtSquare.io believes that ownership of art should be a shared reality accessible to everybody. By donating DAS, you are making someone else part of the innovating and enriching experience of investing in world-class artworks digitally, easily, and flexibly.</p>

<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p>This month <a href="http://bit.ly/ArtSquareHome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtSquare.io</a> has achieved a very important milestone in its journey towards a more open art market. Andy Warhol’s <i>Kiku</i> has become the first artwork to be fully converted into digital art shares, which you can now buy for €1 each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 20, ArtSquare.io was invited to present its innovative vision at the ‘The Future Technology in Art’ event organised by the London Technology Club at the Royal Academy of Arts, London. The breakfast attracted investors in the fine art and creative industries alongside innovators who are using digital tools to change the art world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CEO Fabrizio D’Aloia took part in a panel discussion on the role of technology in shaping the way art is made, displayed, and invested in, alongside Tom Best (The Auction Collective), Harry Blain (Sedition), Bernadine Brocker Wieder (Vastari) and Robert Norton (Verisart).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>“ArtSquare.io uses Blockchain Technology to fractionalise art by issuing digital art shares which represent fractional ownership of artworks. We are opening up a new economic scenario, turning a previously illiquid asset class into a liquid one and encouraging transactions.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fabrizio D’Aloia, CEO at ArtSquare.io</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audience was excited to hear about how fractionalisation and digital co-ownership –aspects which involve the legal and financial aspects of art–go hand in hand with innovations which interest the way we interact with art, such as VR technology. Imagine owning pieces of multiple artworks acquired through ArtSquare.io’s digital live listing: with a VR headset or other kinds of digital projection you will be able to create and navigate your own virtual collection, or again visit an exhibition or museum where the artwork you partially own is shown. Sharing this immersive experience with your friends will be possible in the near future. It was a honour to share ArtSquare.io’s groundbreaking project before LTC members and audience and contribute to the ongoing conversion on the impact of technology on the art world.</p>

			<p><span class="tadv-format-panel">With the </span><b>sale</b><span class="tadv-format-panel"> of our first fully listed artwork–</span><a href="https://www.artsquare.io/announcing-our-first-digital-art-listing-how-it-works-and-how-you-can-get-ready-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Andy Warhol’s <i>Kiku </i></b></a><i><span class="tadv-format-panel">—</span></i><span class="tadv-format-panel"> live, ArtSquare.io is getting ready to launch the second phase of its blockchain-based market, the </span><b>ArtSquare Exchange</b><span class="tadv-format-panel">. <strong>T</strong></span><b>he Exchange is a digital forum where Art Investors can start trading their Digital Art Shares</b><span class="tadv-format-panel"> and enjoying the results of their disinvestment. </span></p>
<p><b>The ArtSquare Exchange</b></p>
<p>Just like in a <b>traditional stock exchange</b>, in ArtSquare.io’s Secondary Market buyers and sellers, offer and demand, come together, bringing about processes of <b>uninterrupted, real-time price formation</b> that are unprecedented for the art market. In the traditional art market, price tags for objects are formed as a result of a number of unclear, unstable and highly subjective factors. In addition to provenance (the track record of ownership of an art object), the inclusion in exhibitions and recent market performances of similar objects influence pre-sale estimates of an artwork, making any consideration on its real value and market potential highly speculative. These indirect processes of price formation are also dangerously discontinuous as they take place only when the artwork comes up for auction or is sold through a gallery.</p>
<p>ArtSquare.io’s system of digital listing of artworks wants to ease the pains of small Art Investors who struggle with these market dynamics. By turning <b>the artwork into tradable shares</b>, ArtSquare.io brings about a process of continuous price formation which <b>eliminates liquidity gaps</b> and <b>high brokerage fees </b>that plague the traditional art market. We see fine art as a new asset class of uncharted potential: through <b>digital fractionalisation, </b>investing in art will guarantee as good a <b>performance </b>as investing in shares of a company on the traditional stock exchange.</p>
<p><b>How Does the Sale of Digital Art Shares on the Secondary Market Work?</b></p>
<p><b>When the sale of Digital Art Shares on the ArtSquare Primary Market ends, we will bring on the secondary market phase.</b> Through the ArtSquare Exchange you can <b>disinvest your Digital Art Shares</b>, allowing others in our community to own fractions of Artworks even if they did not get the chance to buy them through the primary sale during the listing stage. The ArtSquare Exchange relies on a business model based on sale and purchase orders. A Digital Art Share is placed on the Secondary Market at a predetermined price. The sale of a DAS is successful when the Art Investor’s offer meets the seller’s proposed cost for the share. Alternatively, Digital Art Shares can be sold at market value, with the selling order processed instantaneously based on the best available offers. All your transactions will be recorded in the Portfolio, where you can also check your shares and make informed decisions about how to trade them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><img class="aligncenter wp-image-489 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Exchange-divider.jpg" alt="Articles Exchange divider" width="800" height="162"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Exchange-divider.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Exchange-divider-300x61.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Exchange-divider-768x156.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Own the Artwork for Six Months</strong></p>
<p>The Secondary Market is not only a way to diversify your portfolio and make your profits grow; it is also your chance to interact with our community of Art Investors turned co-Art Owners, and make someone else’s dream of owning an artwork come true. As we have already explained <a href="https://www.artsquare.io/announcing-our-first-digital-art-listing-how-it-works-and-how-you-can-get-ready-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, the majority DAS holder for <em>Kiku </em>at the end of the sale on the Primary Market will be able to bring the artwork home for <strong>six months</strong>. The possibility to own the artwork by investing in portions of it is extended to the Exchange stage: at the end of the six-month period, the Investor who, at that moment, owns the greatest number of shares for the artwork–having bought them from the Secondary Market–will be its next Art Owner, and so on.</p>
<p>The ArtSquare Exchange is the final and most exciting component of ArtSquare.io’s new approach to art investments. Get ready for what’s next by buying shares for <em>Kiku</em> for €1 on the Primary Market now.</p>

			<p>ArtSquare wants to bridge the gap between <b>small</b> and <b>big investors</b> in the art market by promoting a new way of buying and selling artworks and collectibles; this is based on the idea of <b>digital co-ownership</b> enabled by <b>blockchain technology</b>.</p>
<p>We have designed a number of solutions that will allow <b>all players</b> in the fine art industry to make the most out of today’s new financial scenarios.</p>
<p>Whether you are an Art Investor or an Art Owner, read through to learn how you can use ArtSquare’s system of tradable Digital Art Shares to create new possibilities for profit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-499 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-galleries.jpg" alt="Articles Art Galleries" width="1024" height="209"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-galleries.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-galleries-300x61.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-galleries-768x157.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Art galleries can use ArtSquare as a channel of sales to reach not only small- and medium-budget art buyers but also those interested in a <b>digital investment experience.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform functions as a <b>marketplace</b> that will help your pieces gain <b>greater attention</b>, reach a <b>wider and new audience</b>, and <b>sell more</b>. Newcomers of the art market who don’t have a multi-million budget and are looking to buy <b>medium-priced art pieces</b> may feel intimidated or lack the experience to do so through a gallery. Moreover, <b>marketing costs</b> and <b>maintenance efforts</b> may <b>discourage art galleries</b> from acquiring medium-priced pieces for their collection. ArtSquare is creating a market for this category of artworks and collectibles and giving art galleries the tools to acquire <b>new customers</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ArtSquare offers  art galleries <b>security, freedom, and control</b> over the artworks they decide to put forward for listing. At the moment of listing on ArtSquare, art galleries will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>decide the <b>percentage of the artwork’s value</b> to be turned into <b>Digital Art Shares</b> through the <b>ArtSquare Primary Market</b></li>
</ol>
<p>2. <b>call back</b> the Digital Art Shares associated with the artwork at a <b>predetermined fixed price</b>, in the event that a single Investor decides to buy the artwork for its total value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you are a <b>private collector</b>, an <b>institution</b>, or a <b>company</b> owning an art collection, ArtSquare offers <b>digital solutions</b> that will allow you to <b>monetize your artworks</b>. By listing and selling shares of your artworks and collectibles through ArtSquare, you can<b> avoid issues of illiquidity</b> that come with <b>fixed financial assets</b>. On the one hand, you will generate <b>revenues </b>and<b> make the value of your collection grow</b> by placing part or whole of it on the market; on the other, you will <b>retain ownership rights </b>for the pieces (for instance, you will still be able to display them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making your artworks liquid means that you can<b> earn money on the investments</b> originally made to put your collection together and use newly-generated liquidity to <b>expand</b> it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectors will access ArtSquare through our Art Pros, appointed art market experts that will help them take the right steps towards a successful listing i.e. producing the relevant documentation and ensuring a fair pricing process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-501 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Auction-houses.jpg" alt="Articles Auction houses" width="1024" height="209"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Auction-houses.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Auction-houses-300x61.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Auction-houses-768x157.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>ArtSquare acts as a <b>third-party venue within the art marke</b>t that reconciles the needs and goals of <b>auction houses</b> with those of <b>private dealers</b> and <b>art buyers</b>. <b>Auction houses</b> can redirect their clients to ArtSquare as a<b> post-sale marketplace</b> where they can see their artworks and collectibles thrive again as <b>co-owned, tradable, and liquid assets</b>. After completing a purchase through an auction house, buyers will be able to sell their artworks or collectibles as <b>shares of assets</b> on the <b>ArtSquare Primary Market</b> and generate <b>new revenues from their original investment.</b> In this way, ArtSquare aims to become the solution to <b>sidestep the drawback of locked liquidity </b>that characterizes art investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By turning artworks and collectibles into <b>shareable assets</b>, we aim to <b>generate liquidity</b> and increase the <b>number of transactions</b> happening across the world of fine art and collectibles. This scenario has a number of <b>advantages for auction houses</b> both in the short and long term: we are confident that <b>this injection of liquidity</b> will lead to the increase in <b>budgets</b> and the number of <b>art investors</b>, and the consequent <b>expansion of the market</b> and the <b>growth of sales</b>. Through ArtSquare, auction houses will continue to share in the <b>financial benefits</b> of the artwork even <b>post-sale</b> in terms of re-investment and expansion of their clientele’s buying power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-502 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Artists.jpg" alt="Articles Artists" width="1024" height="209"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Artists.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Artists-300x61.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Artists-768x157.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>ArtSquare’s <b>dynamic marketplace</b> is a powerful <b>commercial tool</b> for <b>contemporary artists</b>. Artists can use <b>ArtSquare’s channels of sale</b>—<b> ArtSquare Primary Market</b> and the <b>ArtSquare Exchange</b>— to sell their works to a <b>new and wider audience</b> who is excited about innovative ways of navigating the art market. ArtSquare will appoint an<b> Art Pro</b>—usually a <b>gallery</b>—that will work with artists in the <b>pre-listing phase</b>, helping them produce the relevant documentation for the artwork (i.e. <b>provenance</b> and certificate of <b>authenticity</b> of the artwork), determine its <b>value</b>, and locate it on the ArtSquare Primary Market as <b>tradable art shares</b> of predetermined value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artists can also use ArtSquare to <b>fundraise</b> for their projects. There are <b>costs</b> associated with the creation of site-specific installations, paintings, sculptures, multi-media works or even temporary works that emerging artists struggle to cover. <b>Blockchain is taking crowdfunding to the next level: </b>ArtSquare uses blockchain technology to enable <b>artists to raise money for their projects</b>. In the same way as artworks are listed on the ArtSquare Primary Market, artists will be able to <b>list works-in-the-making</b> and divide their total value (including, for instance, <b>production </b>and <b>installation costs</b>) into any number of Digital Art Shares that Art Investors will be able to buy using fiat currencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also an exciting opportunity for Art Investors to act as art patrons: not only they will concretely contribute to the creation of a new artwork, they will also <b>co-own the artwork</b> and <b>share in the revenues</b> generated from its display and sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-503 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-investors.jpg" alt="Articles Art Investors" width="1024" height="209"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-investors.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-investors-300x61.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Art-investors-768x157.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><b>ArtSquare’s goal is to give small and medium investors full freedom to access the market for fine art and collectibles</b>. As an elitist and increasingly financialised forum with unclear regulations and complicated dynamics, <b>the art market is beyond the reach of investors with medium or low budgets</b> and newcomers who lack familiarity with the sector or the connections to enter its hyper-exclusive venues.</p>
<p>Art Investors will be able to <b>buy and trade Digital Art Shares</b> corresponding to portions of the artworks. The price of a single DAS is <b>small enough</b> that Investors will be able to <b>liquidize it easily and flexibly</b>. ArtSquare is bringing about a <b>revolution in the world of art investments</b>: while buying an artwork or collectible through the traditional art market entails a considerable expenditure–which includes commission fees and maintenance costs– and a consequent scenario of locked, illiquid assets in the long term, <b>ArtSquare’s system of issuing Digital Art Shares for artworks allows Investors to diversify the financial risk </b>and <b>enhance the potential for revenues of their portfolio.</b></p>
<p>Instead of investing their capital on a single, highly-priced artwork or collectible, Investors will be able to build a <b>portfolio</b> of different Digital Art Shares representing multiple artworks of various value. <strong><a href="/wallet-currencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtSquare’s Multi-Currency Wallet </a></strong>is a feature that allows Art Investors to keep track of the value of their assets and make informed decisions on their DASs based on the trends and developments of the market. For instance, Art Investors will enjoy the freedom to liquidize some Digital Art Shares and invest in others that grow faster.</p>

			<p><strong>How Art Owners and Investors Can Control their Money on the ArtSquare Platform</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> and <strong>reliability</strong> inspire ArtSquare’s vision of an open and democratic art market. This means not only that a larger audience is finally allowed access to the world of Fine Art; ArtSquare is also giving them <strong>freedom</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong> and empowering them with total control over the way their money moves within the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the Tokenization Process Works for all the Players</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-480 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Tokenization-Process.jpg" alt="Articles Tokenization Process" width="300" height="251" />At the core of ArtSquare’s revolutionary project is <strong>the digital listing of the Artwork</strong>, which involves the virtual division of the Artwork into multiple portions (what we call <strong>Digital Art Shares </strong>or<strong> DAS</strong>). This partition of the value of the Artwork uses Blockchain Technology not just to ensure fairness, security and transparency, but also as a way to prevent liquidity issues that come with art investments. After a few stages that see Art Pros and Art Owners collaborating in reviewing the documentation of the Artwork and setting up the rules for its trade within the platform, Digital Art Shares are finally generated and made available for purchase and trading to the community through the <strong>ArtSquare Primary Market</strong>. The process is not only easy, but also highly reliable thanks to the competent work of ArtSquare’s network of experts, the Art Pros.</p>
<p>The <strong>ArtSquare Primary Market</strong> is the place where Art Investors can go to buy portions of Artworks in the form of Digital Art Shares. ArtSquare gives Owners extra-freedom by allowing them to choose the currency they want to use at the moment of listing the Artwork and creating tradable DAS. This will be the currency that will characterise the exchange of the DAS of their artworks.</p>
<p>Unlike other art investment platforms, ArtSquare allows Investors to purchase DAS by using directly <strong>fiat currencies</strong> – everyday international currencies such as Euro, US Dollar or Pound Sterling. In this way, ArtSquare is able to avoid exposing Art Owners and Investors to fluctuating exchange rates and conversion fees. Some Investors might want to buy some DAS available in a currency different from their own: ArtSquare will make it happen by allowing them to convert any necessary amount into the Owner’s selected currency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Wallet for each Player</strong></p>
<p>ArtSquare proudly introduces the <strong>Multi-Currency Wallet, </strong>an innovative feature that enables both Owners and Investors to keep track of their assets. The Wallet gathers together both fiat currencies and DAS, allowing all players to be in control of each component of their portfolio at all times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-481 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Wallet-for-each-Player.png" alt="Articles Wallet for each Player" width="768" height="401"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Wallet-for-each-Player.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Wallet-for-each-Player-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>With its user-friendly features, it requires none of the knowledge to handle complex financial data that one needs to have to deal with real-life art investments. When an Investor buys DAS using fiat currencies, money is transferred from their Wallet to the Owner’s, while the newly purchased Digital Art Shares are passed on from the Owner’s portfolio to the Investor’s. <strong>The Wallet gathers all of these transactions in the same place</strong>. ArtSquare’s built-in wallet also enables Art Owners and Investors to monitor their assets by having their value expressed <strong>in the currency of their choice</strong>. By simply going into their Wallets, both Owners and Investors can have an overview of their available budget at all times: they can check the price of purchase and sale for the DAS in their possession and get a better idea of the growth of their assets. All of these data are plotted into easily legible charts that will make managing a financial portfolio feel like a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-482 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-your-ArtWallet.jpg" alt="Articles Your ArtWallet" width="800" height="919"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-your-ArtWallet.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-your-ArtWallet-261x300.jpg 261w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-your-ArtWallet-768x882.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>ArtSquare’s idea of bringing the art market closer to the people does not end with turning the Artwork into a liquid asset. By relying on a <strong>Multi-Currency Wallet</strong>, we are also giving Owners and Investors the tools to control their money at each stage of the process and understand concretely the value of their assets.

			<h5>La nuova tecnologia alla base dei Bitcoin consentirà anche a chi non può permettersi opere intere di investire in capolavori, rilevando una o più quote che poi potranno essere rivendute sul mercato come un titolo azionario.</h5>
<p><strong><em>di Paola Pilati</em></strong><em>, Roma. (</em>La Repubblica Affari Finanza 11 Febbraio 2019)</p>
<p>La finanza entra nell’arte. E la fa a pezzi. Ricordate il quadro di Bansky battuto da Sotheby’s per 1,2 milioni di dollari e subito dopo ridotto a striscioline da un trituratore nella cornice? Ripartita in striscioline non fisiche ma virtuali, qualsiasi opera d’arte può essere venduta a investitori e appassionati. I quali potranno rivendere quelle quote sul mercato come si fa con le azioni di un’azienda quotata in Borsa. Si potrà così acquistare una quota di un Picasso o di un Rothko come si possiede un titolo Apple o Eni. Che si tratti di una diavoleria maturata dalla finanza più audace, come sospettano i detrattori, o di un nuovo sistema per “estrarre valore” da uno dei mercati più chiusi ed esclusivi com’è quello dell’arte, come sostengono i supporter, di certo è una novità che sta mettendo a rumore il settore.</p>
<p><strong>TECNOLOGIA DI FRONTIERA</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-522 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-1.jpg" alt="Articles Table 1" width="350" height="280"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-1.jpg 350w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-1-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />Soprattutto perché segna l’ingresso nel mondo meno tecnologico che c’è di una tecnologia di frontiera come la blockchain. Proprio quella che ha permesso la nascita del fenomeno finanziario più pazzo degli ultimi tempi, le criptomonete come Bitcoin ed Ethereum, sta aprendo la strada ad applicazioni in altri settori. L’arte è tra quelli che può rivoluzionare dalle fondamenta. Ne è sicuro un report presentato alla londinese Camera dei Comuni dall’Alan Turing Institute e dall’Oxford Internet Institute, per non dire del convincimento di banche d’affari e giganti della consulenza come Deloitte. Ne è un segnale la crescita delle startup che si occupano di arte, con investimenti quadruplicati a 500 milioni di dollari l’anno.</p>
<p><strong>PERICOLO DI “BIDONI”</strong></p>
<p>Qual è il problema più serio che rende ermetico il mercato dell’arte? La sua scarsa trasparenza. Il fatto che spesso i prezzi reali di transazioni stellari non sono rivelati. Il timore di acquistare una “crosta”, come stava per accadere pochi giorni fa ad un americano con un falso Modigliani da 9 milioni di euro. Di investire una cifra che non corrisponde al valore dell’opera. O di vedere spuntare multipli e copie che ne inquinano l’autenticità. La blockchain può risolverli tutti. Come? Ogni opera e ogni transazione che la riguarda, le informazioni su origine, prezzo a cui è stata venduta e via dicendo, vengono criptati nel registro digitale della blockchain, aperto e verificabile da tutti, ma immutabile e anonimo. Una specie di catasto virtuale che ne rende più affidabili i successivi passaggi di mano. E quindi la liquidità del sistema. Proprio quello che serve alla finanza. E che promette di far affluire nuove risorse a un mercato da 70 miliardi di dollari l’anno. Se n’è accorta subito Christie’s, la casa d’aste di Francois Pinault, che ha fatto un accordo con Artory, società che tiene un registro basato sulla blockchain. Per la prima volta con Artory sono state cristallizzate in un registro web tutte le opere della collezione Barney Ebsworth, battuta da Christe’s l’anno scorso a New York con 323 milioni di incasso. E piattaforme-registro simili stanno nascendo come funghi ovunque, come Codex Protocol, Verisart, Dragonchain, la cinese Bidpoc.</p>
<p>Dal registro alla vendita a pezzi, anzi a token (termine usato per indicare il certificato di possesso registrato nella rete) il passo è breve. L’anno scorso l’ecosistema artistico ha salutato l’asta dell’opera di Handy Warhol “14 Small Electric Chairs”, posseduta dalla galleria londinese Dadiani, attraverso la piattaforma Maecenas. Il quadro ora è al 31 per cento di una platea di possessori di “Art Token”, pagati in criptovaluta. “È la democratizzazione dell’arte”, si entusiasmano sul sito di Maecenas“, e un modo di affrancarsi dalle grandi case d’aste, che chiedono anche il 25 per cento di commissione”. Peccato che da allora l’Art token, con tutte le criptovalute, abbia perso due terzi del suo valore.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-523" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-2-300x230.jpg" alt="Articles Table 2" width="350" height="268"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-2-300x230.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-2.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />Ma la strada è segnata. E l’arte venduta a pezzi si stende come una prateria a chi vuole cavalcarla.</p>
<p>Per garantire la completa finanziarizzazione dell’investimento, il token si può pagare anche in valute reali. E per custodire le preziose opere milionarie che dovranno valorizzarsi per consentire future plusvalenze, si aprono depositi in fortezze a prova di ladro e di fisco tra Svizzera, Lussemburgo, New York. Artsquare, promotori italiani, garantisce che la tecnologia farà rifiorire anche quelli che oggi vivacchiano, come le gallerie. «Invece di buttare soldi nelle fiere, i galleristi potranno vendere a pezzi le loro opere senza muoversi», assicura Fabrizio D’Aloia, che dopo un fund-raising di un milione di sterline sta lavorando a Londra all’esordio della start up, che sarà operativa a settembre come mercato online di arte e oggetti da collezione, dalle auto ai vini. E altrettanto si propone di fare Look Lateral, fondata da Niccolò Veneri Savoia: i collezionisti potranno mettere in vendita il 49 per cento dell’opera, e tenersela a casa. Il guadagno arriverà dalle future transazioni.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-524" src="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-3-291x300.jpg" alt="Articles Table 3" width="350" height="360"  ="/wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-3-291x300.jpg 291w, /wp-content/uploads/Articles-Table-3.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />Il PARERE DEI LEGALI</strong></p>
<p>«Sulla tracciabilità lo strumento blockchain può funzionare», ragiona Silvia Segnalini, avvocato dello studio Danovi esperta di art-tech, «ma sulla Borsa dell’arte ho molte perplessità. Ci vorrebbe un regolatore. E poi il sistema dell’arte ha i suoi rituali: esporre nei posti giusti, essere venduta dai galleristi giusti, comprata dai collezionisti giusti. Se l’opera resta ferma, in casa o in deposito, come si valorizza? Il rischio è di creare una nuova bolla finanziaria». Eppure abbattere la soglia d’ingresso al possesso dell’arte attira molti millennials in cerca della blue chip. Come dimostra il caso di Feral Horses, fondata a Londra dall’italiano Francesco Bellanca. La vendita frazionata – una quota 20 euro – dell’opera “Habemus Hominem” dello scultore Jago, un busto in marmo di Papa Benedetto XVI denudato, è in corso e punta a raccogliere l’80 per cento del valore stimato. Ma stimato da chi? Da un comitato di esperti e dal “big data”. Con il risultato che il suo valore è passato dai 120 mila euro pagati dal collezionista anonimo che la mette in vendita, ai 210 di oggi. L’hanno comprata giovani che dicono di voler “partecipare all’evento”, ma anche supporter dell’artista come l’attrice Nancy Brilli. La novità, in questo caso, è che l’opera farà un tour nei musei per accrescerne il valore. «Puntiamo sulla fruizione pubblica dell’opera, non fare speculazione», assicura Bellanca. Se la vendita non sarà completata le quote verranno restituite, altrimenti tra dieci anni sarà rimessa sul mercato. Per chi vuole vederla, e magari possederne un pezzetto, ora è Palazzo Doria Pamphili a Roma.</p>

		<title>Introducing ArtSquare: the Digital Platform on a Mission to Unshackle the Art Market</title>

			<p>At <a href="https://www.artsquare.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArtSquare.io</a>, it all started with the desire to make the art market reachable. As the word suggests, ArtSquare is an <strong>accessible and free-for-all digital space</strong> –just like a public square–where art is <strong>exchanged</strong>. The platform uses Blockchain Technology to bring the art industry closer to the people and make the sale and purchase of art a shared reality.</p>
<p>The market of Fine Art and Collectibles is one of the most exclusive sectors nowadays, with few incredibly wealthy individuals and institutions controlling the very high prices of these illiquid assets. A limited budget usually prevents the average investor or passionate art lover from accessing the industry; unclear regulations, non-transparent pricing, and confused ownership rights also make it difficult for anyone who lacks knowledge and experience to benefit from it. Not to mention the risk of buying forgeries or overpaying an object. Trusting one’s own judgment in dealing with highly technical matters such as authenticity, provenance–the artwork’s history of ownerships, sales, and loans–and price fluctuation is very risky. If you decide to put your trust in an auction house, you may end up paying up to 25% commission fees for its services. This is true for both sellers and buyers. Some iconic works by Andy Warhol were up for sale at one of Phillips’ latest contemporary art auctions in London. The artist’s <em>Red Lenin</em> sold for more than £81.000, doubling its initial estimate [1]. And this is not including a number of hidden fees that the final buyer had to pay and that auction houses rarely disclose to the public.</p>
<h2><strong>ArtSquare Gives Anyone Access to the Art Market</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine if you could divide any valuable artwork into multiple portions whose value fits your budget. Imagine if you could get some friends to contribute and buy portions of the artwork; a large number of people would then virtually own an, otherwise, unaffordable object. Finally, imagine you and some of your crew of co-owners wanting to sell their shares of the artwork to cash in or invest money in another asset. <strong>Liquidity</strong> is continuously generated, with obvious benefits for both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p><strong>This is how things work in the ArtSquare platform.</strong> Works of Fine Art and Collectibles are listed on the platform and divided into Digital Art Shares <strong>(DAS)</strong>, available for purchase by using fiat currencies to the whole community through the <strong>Primary Market</strong>. Art Owners and Art Investors are the main players that keep the platform going. On one side, <strong>Art Owners </strong>put forward forlisting their art objects, which the platform will then break down into Digital Art Shares (through <strong>the process of digital listing</strong>) and make liquid. On the other, <strong>Art Investors</strong> decide to invest any amount in buying a number of Digital Art Shars of one or multiple artworks. This flexible and dynamic way of buying and selling Digital Art Shares makes also possible the creation of a <strong>Secondary Market, the ArtSquare Exchange</strong>. This will not only allow Art Investors to trade DAS anytime but will also create liquidity and alternative possibilities of investment that will benefit the whole community.</p>
<p><strong>And it all unfolds as easily, safely, and clearly as it sounds. </strong>To ensure fairness and transparency in the whole process of listing and exchanging artworks, ArtSquare relies on a network of experts or <strong>Art Pros</strong>: guarantors of the authenticity and fair evaluation of the artwork, they save interested buyers and owners the trouble of putting together provenance documents and seeking legal guidance. Blockchain does the rest. One of the platform’s main innovations is the creation of a system for storing safely and transparently information related to the artwork, such as authenticity and provenance: the <strong>Artwork Repository</strong>. ArtSquare’s <strong>Modular Smart Contract </strong>will also put an end to confusion when it comes to multi-owned artworks, spelling out ownership rights and the rules for the exchange of Digital Art Shares for both Owners and Investors. All of this information permanently travels with the DAS just as provenance documentation and contracts are passed on and updated from one owner to the other in the non-virtual art market.</p>
<p>Here at ArtSquare, we are determined to handle the faults of the art market by making changes from within. This is what matters most to us: that the art market become accessible to a new class of investors who will finally bring <strong>transparency </strong>and <strong>liquidity </strong>to the industry.</p>
